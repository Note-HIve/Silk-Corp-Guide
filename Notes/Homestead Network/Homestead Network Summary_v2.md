### **Homestead Network Summary**

**O - Objective**  
The objective of our initiative is to **sustainably operate a homestead on a collection of ten 1/4 acre lots** located in suburban or rural towns within the Mid-Ohio Valley. Each lot, which already has a townhouse, will be transformed into a model of sustainable agriculture, utilizing native plants and powerful pollinators to create a thriving ecosystem. Our goal is to establish a sustainable farmers market that not only sells produce but also educates the community about the benefits of native planting and pollinator health. We will meticulously document our research findings and share them on the **Homestead Network website**, making our insights accessible to homesteading enthusiasts, agricultural students, and the general public. By collaborating with scientists and experts in the field, we aim to create a replicable model that demonstrates how urban and suburban spaces can contribute to sustainable food systems and ecological health.

**R - Resources**  
Our project will leverage a range of resources to ensure its success:

-   **Housing**: We have access to **10 townhouses**, each associated with a 1/4 acre lot, which will serve as both residences and operational bases for our homesteading activities.
-   **Human Resources**: We will engage **J1 students** specializing in botany and hospitality to provide skilled labor, enriching our research and farming practices.
-   **Land**: Each 1/4 acre lot will be dedicated to experimental farming, focusing on native crops and pollinator plants to optimize biodiversity and sustainability.
-   **Educational Partners**: Collaborations with **local schools** will allow for educational visits, while **INSTAR Lab** (Research Institute) will support our research efforts, and **Tao Learning Institute** (an education non-profit) will assist in outreach and educational programming.
-   **Funding Opportunities**: We will explore grants from **USDA** and **NRCS** that align with our agricultural and sustainability goals, ensuring financial backing for our endeavors.

**B - Budget**  
A comprehensive budget will be meticulously crafted to outline the allocation of funds for various components of the project. This will include:

-   Operational costs for farming activities (seeds, plants, tools).
-   Development of educational materials (printing, website maintenance).
-   Expenses related to hosting farmers' markets (permits, marketing).
-   Salaries or stipends for agricultural students and J1 workers.
-   Research costs (equipment, data analysis, publications).

By presenting a transparent and detailed budget, we aim to build trust with potential funders and stakeholders, demonstrating our commitment to responsible financial management and sustainability.

**I - Indicators (KPIs)**  
We will establish clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of our initiative, including:

-   The number of educational materials produced and distributed (e.g., articles, videos, pamphlets).
-   Levels of community engagement, tracked through attendance at school visits and farmers' market events.
-   Quantitative research outcomes, such as crop yields and diversity metrics for native plants and pollinators.
-   Revenue generated from farmers' market sales and rental income from townhouses, which will support ongoing operations.

These indicators will help us quantify our impact and adapt our strategies based on what is working effectively.

**T - Transports**  
A network of partnerships will support our operational logistics:

-   **Mt Cottages**: Management of the rental properties that provide financial support for the project.
-   **Tao Management**: Oversight of land operations, ensuring sustainable practices are implemented effectively.
-   **Homestead Network**: Platform for publishing educational content and sharing our research findings with the community.
-   **United Home**: Collaboration with a homeowners association focused on promoting sustainable living initiatives within the community.
-   **SILK Corp**: Partnership with hospitality and homestead business professionals to enhance the educational and operational aspects of our project.

These partnerships will facilitate resource sharing, knowledge exchange, and community engagement.

**A - Activities**  
Our initiative will encompass a variety of engaging activities:

-   **Planting native and specialty crops** to enhance biodiversity and contribute to local ecosystems.
-   **Labeling plants** to facilitate educational opportunities for visitors and school groups.
-   **Hosting farmers' markets** to sell produce and engage the community in discussions about sustainability and ecology.
-   **Developing and distributing educational content** (e.g., magazines, videos) aimed at sharing insights and research findings with a broader audience.
-   **Organizing school visits** to foster connections with local educational institutions and inspire the next generation of homesteaders.

These activities will create a vibrant and educational environment that supports our objectives.

**L - MEL Plan**  
A robust Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) plan will be integral to our project, guiding our efforts in tracking progress and assessing impact. The MEL plan will include:

-   Regular assessments of project activities against established KPIs to ensure we are on track to meet our goals.
-   Feedback mechanisms to gather insights from community members, participants, and partners, enabling us to make data-driven adjustments to our approach.
-   Documentation of outcomes and lessons learned, which will be shared on the Homestead Network website to promote transparency and encourage replication of our model by others.

This structured approach will ensure that our initiative not only succeeds in its objectives but also contributes valuable knowledge to the fields of sustainable agriculture and community education.
