# EOD report
## Happy Thursday

- I go through the whole SILK Guide repository and checked which issues are completed and which still need some work to be done. I assigned those issues where work is needed to the team.
- I had a 1 hour session with the SILK team on VS code. We downloaded the VS Code insiders, teach them how to clone the repo and how to create branch.
- I had a meeting for about 15 minutes with members who are interested in working at United Homes. Go through all the properties and share the introduction of the SILK.
- I created pull requests on issue# 211- [Stress management](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/301), issue# 211- [Reliable](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/300), and issue# 289- [Competitive Advantages](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/299).
- I reviewed new PRs and also commented there for changes or approve them. Also, communicating with the team back to back to clear their queries.
