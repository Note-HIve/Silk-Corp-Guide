Master of Science in Strategic Orbital Management
Master of Science in Orbital Business Sustainability
Master of Science in Strategic Astrophysical Leadership

Based on the detailed program information and goals provided, here is my analysis on potential master's degree names and a final recommended shortlist:

Potential Names Analyzed:
1. Master of Science in Orbital Dynamics and Organizational Leadership
2. Master of Science in Universal System Frameworks 
3. Master of Science in Strategic Physics for Resilient Organizations
4. Master of Science in Classical Physics and Lifecycle Software Management
5. Master of Science in Quantum Dynamics for Global Leadership
6. Master of Science in Organizational Physics and Sustainable Software Ops
7. Master of Science in Unified Physics Strategies for Business

Final Shortlist Recommendations:

1. Master of Science in Orbital Dynamics and Organizational Leadership
Pros: Clearly conveys the orbital/physics methodology and leadership focus. "Dynamics" implies a scientific, systems-based approach.
Cons: May seem too technically complex for some non-science students. Misses software management component.

2. Master of Science in Organizational Physics and Sustainable Software Ops  
Pros: Captures organizational physics, software operations, and sustainability themes. "Ops" ties to the Android Ops framework.
Cons: Slightly long name. Using just "physics" may miss the classical/orbital specifics.

3. Master of Science in Strategic Physics for Resilient Organizations
Pros: Emphasizes strategic applications of physics for organizational resilience. Broad appeal.
Cons: Doesn't overtly mention software lifecycle component. May seem management-consulting oriented.

Analysis:
The top choices balance communicating the unique orbital/physics basis with attractive terminology for diverse students. Importantly, all three clearly convey this is a scientifically-grounded program for students interested in that rigor.

"Orbital Dynamics and Organizational Leadership" is most explicit about the orbital models and leadership development aims. However, it may come across as quite technical to non-STEM prospects.

"Organizational Physics and Sustainable Software Ops" has an innovative, modern feel by combining the physics principles with sustainable software operations - appealing to tech-minded students.

"Strategic Physics for Resilient Organizations" takes more of an organizational strategy/consulting perspective, which could appeal to business-oriented individuals. But it's potentially vague on the software lifecycle piece.

Ultimately, "Organizational Physics and Sustainable Software Ops" may strike the best balance by:
1) Using the broadly attractive term "Organizational Physics" 
2) Incorporating "Sustainable Software Ops" to cover the Android Ops framework
3) Appealing to tech interests with "Ops" while remaining decipherable to non-STEM fields

This blended focus could maximize appeal across computer science, business, communications, and psychology backgrounds that you are targeting.

I'd recommend that name as the top choice, with "Strategic Physics for Resilient Organizations" as a backup if you prefer emphasizing the strategic/leadership angle more directly.

Let me know if you need any other analysis or have additional criteria to evaluate potential names against! I'm happy to provide other options and insights.
