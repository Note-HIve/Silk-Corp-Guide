# Purpose:
Under the H-3 visa regulations, the primary purpose of your stay in the U.S. should be to receive training that is not available in your home country, and any productive employment should be incidental and necessary to the training¹. The visa does not generally allow for regular employment in the U.S., which would include working as a virtual assistant for an employer back in your home country.

However, since you would be continuing with your existing job remotely, and not taking up new employment in the U.S., this may fall into a gray area. The key consideration is whether this remote work interferes with the training objectives of the H-3 visa. If the work as a virtual assistant is completely separate from the training program and does not constitute "productive employment" as defined by the visa regulations, it might be permissible.

Given the complexities of immigration law and the potential consequences of violating visa conditions, it's crucial to seek advice from an immigration attorney or a legal expert. They can provide a definitive answer based on the specifics of your situation and ensure that you remain in compliance with all visa requirements while in the U.S.
