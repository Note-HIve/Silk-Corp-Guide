What is H-3 VISA



The H-3 visa is a nonimmigrant visa issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for two purposes:

Trainees: For foreign nationals coming to the United States to participate in a specific training program that will enhance their skills and knowledge in their field.
Special Education Exchange Visitors: For individuals involved in a special education exchange program focused on working with children with disabilities.
There are some key limitations to be aware of:

Training Focus: The training must not be readily available in the applicant's home country and cannot be graduate medical education or training.
Work Restrictions: Trainees cannot be primarily employed in a regular U.S. job. Any work performed must be incidental and directly related to the training program.
Temporary Status: The H-3 visa is temporary, with a maximum validity of two years for trainees and 18 months for special education exchange visitors.
Non-immigrant Intent: Applicants must demonstrate a strong intention to return to their home country after completing the program.
Obtaining an H-3 visa can be challenging, so consulting with an immigration attorney is advisable, especially considering the specific requirements for both the applicant and the training program itself.
