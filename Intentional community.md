## Intentional communities are planned residential communities designed to have a high degree of social cohesion and teamwork. The members of an intentional community typically share common values, goals, or interests, and they often work together to create a lifestyle that reflects those shared principles. These communities can take various forms, including ecovillages, co-housing, communes, and cooperative housing.

### Key characteristics of intentional communities include:

* Shared Values and Goals: Members often come together around a common purpose, such as environmental sustainability, social justice, or spiritual growth.

* Collaborative Decision-Making: Many intentional communities use consensus or other collaborative decision-making processes to ensure that all members have a voice in the governance of the community.

* Resource Sharing: Resources such as housing, food, and transportation are often shared among members to reduce costs and environmental impact.

* Community Activities: Regular communal activities, such as shared meals, work projects, and social events, help to strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of belonging.

* Sustainability: Many intentional communities prioritize sustainable living practices, including organic farming, renewable energy use, and waste reduction.

* Intentional communities can vary widely in size, structure, and focus, but they all aim to create a supportive and cooperative living environment that aligns with the values and aspirations of their members.
